# TamedPUMA: safe and stable imitation learning with geometric fabrics 

Code accompanying the paper "TamedPUMA: safe and stable imitation learning with geometric fabrics" (L4DC 2025) :tiger:. 
The paper is available at RELEASED_SOON, and our [website](https://autonomousrobots.nl/paper_websites/pumafabrics) contains several videos and background material. 

TamedPUMA is a safe and stable extension of learned stable motion primitives (PUMA) augmented with the recently developed
geometric fabrics for safe and stable operations in the presence of obstacles.
Examples include a KUKA iiwa manipulator performing a tomato-picking task and pouring task, and illustrative point-robot examples. 
The examples with a gen3-lite kinova and kinova with Clearpath base are under construction.

If there are questions or issues, please open a Github Issue and we will be in touch!

## Installation:
### Install via poetry
```bash
poetry lock
poetry install
poetry update
```

### Install via pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Steps to run an example
### Training a DNN
To run any example, an appropriate DNN should be trained. 

For example, for  examples/point_robot_PUMA.py, you need to train a network a second order 2D network, i.e. 2nd_order_2D.
Train a network via [train.py](pumafabrics/puma_adapted/train.py).
Indicate the correct parameter-file found in the folder [params](pumafabrics/puma_adapted/params) by replacing the default argument (or give an argument) to be: 2nd_order_2D:
 ```bash
parser.add_argument('--params', type=str, default='2nd_order_2D', help='')
 ```
The training time depends on the "max_iterations" in the [parameter file](pumafabrics/puma_adapted/params/2nd_order_2D.py), you can lower this parameter to reduce training time.
Default parameters result in training between 20 min and 2h depending on the network complexity and your PC. 

### Running an example
Execute one of the example scripts from within the [examples](examples)-folder. For a point-mass example of TamedPUMA:
```bash
point_robot_TamedPUMA_CPM.py
```

For a KUKA iiwa 14 example:
```bash
kuka_TamedPUMA.py
```
